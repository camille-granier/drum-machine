This drum machine is part of the Free Code Camp challenges, in the front end libraries certification.
The goal was to use one of the studied front end libraries to implement this drum-machine.

I used React and realised this project with the help of a great tutorial from [DwinaTech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayzjJojcLXI&t=5s).

You can have a view of this project on my [codepen](https://codepen.io/Dacelo/full/MWvOgdM), where I did most of the work.
